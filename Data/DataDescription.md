# Data Description
In this competition, we are provided a time-series forecasting problem centered around restaurant visitors.
The data comes from two separate sites:
 -> Yomato(yom) - which uses high performance grouping (hpg) to collect and store restaurant data.
 -> Chwiggy(chw) - which uses all index restaurant (air) to collect and store the restaurant data.
We have use the reservations, visits, and other information from these sites to forecast future restaurant
visitor totals on a given date. The training data covers the dates from 2016 until early (first week) April 2017.
The test set covers the mid weeks (second and third weeks) of April 2017. The training and testing set both
omit days where the restaurants were closed.
